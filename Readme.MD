Knowledge Path is an interactive subject pathfinder for the curious and unfocused mind to quickly hone in on an interesting topic.

To do this, three interesting facts are presented to the user to select from, starting with facts from the three primary branches of science - Formal, Life, and Natural. After selection, three more facts are presented in subcategories based on the previous selection. Once a tree's endpoint has been reached, the subject tree path is shown to the user.

A JSON document holds the data for each category.
